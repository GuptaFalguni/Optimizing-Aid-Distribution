# Optimizing Aid Distribution Using Unsupervised Learning

## Problem Statement
HELP International, a humanitarian NGO, has raised $10 million to aid underdeveloped countries. The goal is to categorize countries based on socio-economic and health factors to identify those in dire need of aid, allowing strategic and effective resource allocation.

## Objective
Task is to categorize countries using unsupervised learning techniques based on socio-economic and health metrics. These insights will help prioritize aid distribution to regions most in need.

## Key Insights
- Countries are categorized based on factors such as healthcare, education, and economic development.
- Regions in Africa and parts of Asia were identified as areas requiring the most attention.
- Visualization tools (e.g., world maps) were used to aid in decision-making.
## Recommendations
- **Healthcare:** Focus on improving healthcare infrastructure and sanitation.
- **Education:** Invest in literacy and educational programs.
- **Economic Support:** Boost local economies for sustainable growth.
By focusing on these areas, HELP International can maximize the impact of their resources and improve the quality of life for those in need.
